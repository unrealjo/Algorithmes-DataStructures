# Array Data Structure

## Definition

![Array](array.png)

An array is a fundamental data structure used in computer programming to store a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array is accessed through an index, which is an integer value that represents its position within the array.

## Common array methods :

1.  `length`: Returns the number of elements in the array.
2.  `push`: Adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length.
3.  `pop`: Removes the last element from the array and returns it.
4.  `shift`: Removes the first element from the array and returns it, shifting all subsequent elements to the left.
5.  `unshift`: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array, shifting all existing elements to the right, and returns the new length.
6.  `splice`: Adds or removes elements from the array at a specific position, shifting all subsequent elements to maintain the contiguous memory layout.
7.  `slice`: Returns a new array containing a subset of elements from the original array, based on the specified start and end index.
8.  `indexOf`: Searches the array for a specific element and returns its index, or -1 if it is not found.
9.  `sort`: Sorts the elements in the array in ascending or descending order.
10.  `reverse`: Reverses the order of elements in the array.
