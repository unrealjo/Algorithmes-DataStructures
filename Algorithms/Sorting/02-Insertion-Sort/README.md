# Insertion Sort

## Description

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building up a sorted array one element at a time. The algorithm starts with an empty sorted array and inserts each element from the input array in its correct position in the sorted array. The process is repeated until all elements are in the sorted array.

## Complexity

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it inefficient for large arrays. However, it has the advantage of being efficient for small arrays or arrays that are partially sorted, as well as being easy to understand and implement. The algorithm is also useful as a building block for more complex sorting algorithms.
